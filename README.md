# :tada: Aloha - *A Library of Helpful Articles*

This is the official repository for [Aloha](), the library of helpful articles that helps master
your craft. This is where authors showcase their knowledge on everything to do with the development
and production of software. Best practices and tips are shared in well written article with a functionality
that allows readers and peers to comment on the article.

## How it works
To gain access to these helpful articles, you first of all need to create an account. This will allow you to publish
 articles and also react to articles published by other authors. To ensure that this platform remains stays true
 to its mission, articles that are published will be moderated. This means that articles that do not meet the do
 not meet our high standards of quality will be taken down. However, in order to preseve the dignity of each 
 publisher, they will be contacted privately to either take it down themselves and update the content. It is only when
 they fail to do so that we will effectively remove the article.

 ## Mission
Our mission is to make computer science accessible to everyone. And when we say everyone, that include everyone you
can think of. In order to achieve our mission, we intend to include the functionality to allow authors to include 
both audio and video files of their articles to ensure it is accessible to all.
